					<h3 class="card-title">Introduction</h3>
					<p class="card-text">
						The goal of this assignment is to implement a text-based "Nonogram" game. You can check this
						Wikipedia link <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram" target="_blank">here</a>
						for a historical overview of this genre of games.
					</p>

					<p class="card-text">
						Nonogram is like "a combination of Minesweeper" and "Sudoku". Each cell on the board must be
						colored or left blank according to numbers at the side of the board (we call them
						"row constraints" and "column constraints")
						to reveal a hidden pixel art-like picture.
					</p>

					<p class="card-text">
						The numbers (i.e., "row constraints" and "column constraints")
						measures how many unbroken lines of filled-in squares there are in any given row or column.
						For example, a constraint of "4 8 3" would mean there are sets of four, eight, and three
						filled squares, <it>in that order</it>, with <it>at least one blank square</it>
						between successive sets.
						You may check the <a href="#introduction">banner above</a> to see how constraints work.
						That banner is a solved nonogram.
					</p>

					<br>
					<p class="card-text">
						In this assignment, you are required to:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Implement the game mechanisms outlined in Tasks 1 - 4.
						</li>
						<li>
							Implement a <i>solver</i>, which generate a Nonogram solution
							(or any, if there are multiple solutions) that satisfies
							all the constraints (Tasks 5 - 9).
						</li>
					</ul>

						Please read the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> section for some common clarifications. You should check that

					<br>


					<h4>Gameplay</h4>
					<p class="card-text">
						During each round, the game interface displays a menu asking the user to select an action:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<code>p</code> (print) - print the current board
						</li>
						<li>
							<code>m</code> (modify) - user set/unset (color/leave blank) a certain cell
						</li>
						<li>
							<code>c</code> (check) - check if the current board is a valid solution
						</li>
						<li>
							<code>s</code> (solve) - invoke Nonogram solver to solve the game
						</li>
						<li>
							<code>q</code> (quit) - quit the game and ends the program
						</li>
					</ul>
					<br>

					<h4 id="description-solver">Solver</h4>
					<p class="card-text">
						You are required to write a solver that (most likely) uses recursion.
						Please refer to <a href="comp2012h_pa3_files/nonogram-paper.pdf">this paper</a>
						about an overview of how the solver works.
						You don't need to know what is DFS or backtracking, just reading the process in
						<strong>III. USING DFS TO SOLVE NONOGRAM PUZZLE</strong> is good enough.
					</p>

					<p class="card-text">
						Don't worry if you are still confused about how to implement such an algorithm after
						reading the paper. We will give you detailed instructions on
						implementing some helper functions (Task 5 - 8), and we hope they will
						help you come up with an idea about how to design a solver with the help of them.
					</p>

					<p class="card-text">
						During grading process, we ensure the board we input has <strong>only one</strong> valid solution.
						So you don't need to worry the cases when (1) there is no solution, or
						(2) there are multiple solutions. When you are implementing the solver, you may choose
						either to (1) quit after finding one solution, or (2) quit after finding all solutions.
						However, we suggest you do the former, since if your solver takes too much time during
						execution, you may lose some scores.
					</p>

					<br>

					<h4 id="description-global-var">Global variables</h4>
					<p class="card-text">
						Since some variables that representing game states will be used in many functions,
						we make them global for simplicity. Here are a list of them:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<strong>Global Constants:</strong> (defined at the beginning)
						<li>
							<code>const int MAX_ROW = 15, MAX_COL = 15, MAX_CONSTRAINT_NUM = 15</code>
							- maximum number of rows/columns/constraints of the game board in this assignment.
						</li>
						<strong>For game board:</strong> (defined at the beginning)
						<li>
							<code>int num_rows, num_cols</code> - number of rows / columns in the game board.
						</li>
						<li>
							<code>char board[MAX_ROW][MAX_COL]</code> - the game board represented by a 2D character array,
							<code>'.'</code> means the cell is left blank,
							<code>'X'</code> means colored.
						</li>
						<li>
							<code>int num_row_constraints[MAX_ROW], num_col_constraints[MAX_COL]</code> -
							number of constraints for each row / column. For example, if
							row 0 has constraint "4 3 5", then
							<code>num_row_constraints[0] = 3</code>.
							This actually records the length of
							<code>int row_constraints[][], col_constraints[][]</code> below.
						</li>
						<li>
							<code>int row_constraints[MAX_ROW][MAX_CONSTRAINT_NUM],
								col_constraints[MAX_COL][MAX_CONSTRAINT_NUM]</code> -
							row / column constraints. For each row / column, there are
							multiple numbers in its constraint, so we need an array to store it.
							The length of array is stored in
							<code>int num_row_constraints[], num_col_constraints[]</code>
							introduced above.
						</li>
						<br>
						<strong>For solver:</strong> (defined after Task 6)
						<li>
							<code>int num_row_perms[MAX_ROW]</code> - number of valid permutations for each row.
						</li>
						<li>
							<code>char row_perms[MAX_ROW][MAX_PERM][MAX_COL]</code> -
							stores all valid permutations for each row.
							For example, <code>char row_perms[i][j][k]</code> represents
							for row <code>i</code>, in the <code>j</code>-th valid permutation,
							whether the cell at column <code>k</code> is colored or left blank.
						</li>
					</ul>


					<h4>Additional Remarks</h4>
					<p class="card-text">
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							You are allowed to define your own helper functions, but be careful as ZINC won't be able to know
							of their existence. This shouldn't be a problem as long as the changes to the game state variables
							and task function return values are as expected.
						</li>
						<li>
							All the task functions are in global scope, and you are allowed to have the task functions call
							each other for easier implementation. Be careful when two or more functions call each other
							reciprocally, as they may enter an infinite loop.
						</li>
						<li>
							You are free (but not strictly required) to use recursion in any of the task functions. Some
							recursion hints are given in the tasks, but otherwise the final decision is up to you. Avoid
							accidental infinite recursion.
						</li>
						<li>
							You are only allowed to use one header file <code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</code>.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>You are strongly discouraged to modify the <code>main</code> function given in
							skeleton.</strong> It will be replaced when we grade your program.
							<strong>You are strictly forbidden to modify the signature of task functions</strong>.
							However, you can overload them. When we grade your program, if we cannot find
							the exact function whose signature is what we described in
							<a href="#tasks">Tasks section</a>, you will have <strong>no score</strong> for that task.
							This situation is unlikely to occur if you never modified the <code>main</code> function.

				<br>
				<h4 id="task1">Task 1 - Implement the <code>get_input_board()</code> function</h4>
				<p class="card-text">
					<b>Description</b> - This function asks user to input the board size and constraints,
					check if the constraints are valid,
					store the information in global variables and finally initialize the board.
				</p>

				<p class="card-text">
					<b>Read constraints</b> - The function will ask user to input constraints
					row by row, and then column by column. For each row / column, user need to
					input a list of numbers, separated by a space, to indicate the constraint for
					this row / column. Since the constraint can be of any length, the user will
					enter <code>-1</code> at the end, meaning that the constraint for this row / column
					is ended. If there is no constraint for this row / column, the user should
					simply enter -1. You may refer to the example below for details.
				</p>

				<p class="card-text">
					<b>Validity checking</b> - It is not easy to check if the constraints are valid, for example,
					you may think if the constraints result in no solution, they are invalid. However,
					in current stage we are unable to check such complex stuff. So in this function,
					you only need to check <strong>if the row / column has enough space to possibly
					hold such constraints</strong>. For example, if a row constraint is "4 3 5", since
					two adjacent groups require at least 1 blank cell between, we at least need
					4 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 5 = 14 cells in this row. Hence, if <code>num_cols</code>
					is smaller than 14, this is invalid. You only need to check this situation.

				<ul>
					<li>
						You may assume the user always input a valid integer for number of rows / columns,
						i.e., an integer between <code>1</code> and <code>MAX_ROW / MAX_COL</code>.
					</li>
					<li>
						You may assume the user always input positive integers for row / column constraints,
						except for the -1 used to flag input termination.
					</li>
					<li>
						You may assume the number of user input row/column constraints never exceeds the number of the row/columns, e.g.,
						if the board size is 3 row by 4 col, the user will input &le; 3 row constraints for each row and &le; 4 column constraints.
					</li>
					<li>
						If the constraints input by user is not valid, this function will
						tell the user "Invalid row / column constraint, please try again.", and
						keep asking user to re-input the constraint.
					</li>
					<li>
						Some code snippets have been given for you in the skeleton.
						You may directly use them for output format.

				<h3 style="text-align: center" id="tasks-part3">Part III: A nonogram solver.</h3>
				<br>
				<p class="card-text">
					Please make sure you have read the paper in <a href="#description-solver">description section</a>
					about how we are going to implement the solver.
				</p>
				<p class="card-text">
					Basically, the steps are:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						For each row, choose one permutation and fill it on the board
					</li>
					<li>
						Check if current board does not violate column constraints.
						(It cannot violate row constraints, since we used a valid row permutation)
						<ul>
							<li>
								If not violate, proceed on next row, until all rows are filled
							</li>
							<li>
								If violate, go to step 1, choose another permutation
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>

				<p class="card-text">
					Now the problems are: (1) how to generate permutations for each row,
					and (2) how to check a board does not violate column constraints. Notice here
					the board is incomplete.
				</p>

				<p class="card-text">
					For generating permutations, we can first generate a left-aligned permutation as
					a starter. For example, if the row constraint is <code>{2, 1, 3}</code>, and
					there are 12 columns, then a left-aligned permutation is:
					<code>[X X . X . X X X . . . .]</code>, i.e., start filling cells from left most,
					and separate each group by only one empty cell.
				</p>

				<p class="card-text">
					Then, to generate other permutations <it>based on the starter</it>, we check
					if any group can be shifted to the right. In the example above, the last group
					can be shifted to the right by 1, 2, 3, or 4 cells (more shifts will hit the boundary),
					which will produce 4 other permutations.
					And after the last group is shifted, you may also check
					if the second group can be shifted. For example, when the last group is shifted
					by 2 cells, the second group can be shifted to the right by 1 or 2 cells.
					(more shifts will hit the last group)
					The same process should be done on the first group. In this way you are able
					to generate all permutations for a row.
				</p>

				<p class="card-text">
					<b>Task 7</b> asks you to generate all permutations for a certain row,
					and <b>Task 6</b> asks you to check if a certain group can be shifted, as we described above.
					<b>Task 5</b> acts as a useful helper function, since it's convenient for us to only
					focus on <i>which column does each group start</i>, rather than how the row really looks like.
				</p>

				<br>

				<p class="card-text">
					For checking whether current board violates column constraints, it is similar to what
					we have done in <code>check_whole_board_valid()</code>, except for
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						We don't need to check the row constraints, since the row permutations we generated must
						not violate row constraints.
					</li>
					<li>
						We don't check the whole board. The board is not complete yet, we only need to check
						the rows that we have finished.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="card-text">
					You will be asked to implement this function in <b>Task 8</b>.
				</p>

				<br>

				<p class="card-text">
					Finally, you will be asked to implement the complete solver in <b>Task 9</b>.
					We expect you to make use of those previous functions that you have written.
				</p>
				<br>

				<h4>Task 5 - Implement the <code>positions_to_row()</code> function</h4>
				<p class="card-text">
					<b>Description</b> - This function coverts a <strong>position vector</strong> of a row
					into a <strong>real row</strong>, where
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						A <strong>position vector</strong> is a 1D integer array, with known length.
						It stores the beginning indices for each colored group in the row.
						For example, if a row has 2 constraints, we expect there are 2 colored groups,
						and the position vector will record at which column do the 2 groups starts.
					</li>
					<li>
						A <strong>real row</strong> is a 1D character array. If a
						<strong>position vector</strong> is given, along with the row constraints,
						you will be able to figure out how the row looks like.
					</li>
					<li>
						For example, if <code>num_col = 8, position vector = {0, 3, 5},</code>
						row_constraint for this row is <code>{2, 1, 1}</code>, then the row should be:
						<code>[X X . X . X . .]</code><br>
						Explanation: there are 3 groups in this row, since there are 3 numbers in row constraint.
						Hence the position vector should have 3 elements.
						The first <code>0</code> means the 1st group starts at column 0, and since we
						know the first constraint is 2, so column 0 and column 1 must be colored.
						Similarly, the <code>3</code> in the position vector means the 2nd group
						starts at column 3, and since we know the second constraint is 1, so only column 3 is colored.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<pre><code class="language-cpp">void positions_to_row(int row_idx, const int positions[], int num_pos, char result_row[]);</code></pre>
				<p class="card-text">
					<b>Parameters</b>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<code class="language-cpp">int row_idx</code> - which row we are working on.
					</li>
					<li>
						<code class="language-cpp">int positions[]</code> - the position array given.
					</li>
					<li>
						<code class="language-cpp">int num_pos</code> - the length of the given position array.
					</li>
					<li>
						<code class="language-cpp">char result_row[]</code> - you need to store your
						converted <string>real row</string> in this array.
						Note that you don't need to specify the length, it must have the length of
						<code>num_cols</code>.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="card-text">
					<b>Notes</b>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						You may assume the parameters passed into this function are always valid
						<i>during grading process</i>. However, since this function is used as a helper function
						in later tasks, you need to be careful that you always pass in valid parameters
						when you invoke it in other functions.

				<h4>Task 6 - Implement the <code>block_can_shift()</code> function</h4>
				<p class="card-text">
					<b>Description</b> - This function checks if the given block on given row can be shifted to the

					For example, if the position vector is <code>{0, 4, 6}</code>, <code>num_col = 8</code>,
					row_constraint for this row is <code>{2, 1, 1}</code>,
					then the row is: <code>[X X . . X . X .]</code>, and there are 3 blocks.
					Then,

				<ul>
					<li>
						<code>block_can_shift(row_idx, 0, {0, 4, 6}) = true,</code>
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>block_can_shift(row_idx, 1, {0, 4, 6}) = false,</code>

				<p class="card-text">
				<strong>Deadline: <span style="color: red;">Sat, 1/10/22</span> HKT 23:59.</strong><br>
					Compress the single source code file <code>main.cpp</code> by itself as <code>PA3.zip</code>
					for submission to the <a href="https://zinc.cse.ust.hk/">ZINC Autograding System</a>.
					The ZINC submisssion portal is available.
				</p>
				<p class="card-text">
				<strong>Late Policy:</strong><br>
				Please refer to the <a href="https://course.cse.ust.hk/comp2012h/#assignments">3-day late budget policy</a>.
				</p>
				<p class="card-text">
					<strong>You are strongly discouraged to modify the <code>main</code> function given in
						skeleton.</strong> It will be replaced when we grade your program.
					<strong>You are strictly forbidden to modify the signature of task functions</strong>.
					However, you can overload them. When we grade your program, if we cannot find
					the exact function whose signature is what we described in
					<a href="#tasks">Tasks section</a>, you will have <strong>no score</strong> for that task.
					This situation is unlikely to occur if you never modified the <code>main</code> function.
				</p>
				<p class="card-text">
					Before deadline, the test cases on ZINC will only contain a few cases. If you passed
					those tests, it only means your program can successfully run on ZINC and can pass
					those test cases. The result is by no means complete and the score are irrelavent to
					your actual score.
					In actual grading stage after deadline, we will use a <strong>totally different set of
					test cases</strong>, which is expected to be more complete and more strict,
					to test the correctness your program.<br>
					<strong>You are hence strongly suggested to test your program thoroughly by thinking about all possible cases.</strong>
				</p>
				<br>
				<h4>Grading Scheme</h4>
				<p class="card-text">
					The actual grading will use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing", target="_blank">Unit Testing</a>,
					i.e., we will test each functions individually, invoke the function you implemented,
					and check the return value/expected behavior of that function.
					The actual grading will also only be triggered, with the scores and test cases revealed, after the
					deadline. This hidden grading policy is for all the PAs in order to prevent reverse-engineering of
					the test cases, since the PAs are a significant part of the course assessment and course grade.
				</p>
				<p class="card-text">
					We will execute unit testing on the task functions individually, and some
					of the test cases may include invalid input values. In general, you can assume that:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						As long as we are testing solver part, i.e. Task 5 - Task 9, you can assume the parameters
						passed into those functions are always valid during unit testing.
						And you can also assume there is <strong>only one final solution</strong> for the board
						and constraints given.
					</li>
					<li>
						For other input parameters, if you are required to check the validity of parameters,
						we have explicitly told you what to check in <a href="#tasks">Tasks section</a>.
						You don't need to consider other cases.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="card-text">
					<strong>Additional remark for solver: </strong>
					You are strongly discouraged to use another approach to implement solver instead of
					using the helper functions we described in Task 5 - 8.
					If you want to do so, you are also required to complete Task 5 - 8 to get scores for those tasks,
					even if your solver never uses them. Otherwise, even your solver is correct, you
					will only get the score for Task 9.
					Please note it's expected that the solver only worth a small part of scores, and Task 5 - 8
					should worth (more likely) more scores.

					Nonogram Puzzles are considered as NP-Complete problems which cannot be completed in polynomial time.
					And the solution described in this assignment uses recursion and depth-frist search to traverse through
					all possibilities to find the answer. It has a high time complexity of <code>O(n^2*logn)</code>.<br>
					In Task 9 of this assignment, we also encourage you to optimize your code to achieve faster solution speed.
					Your programs will be evaluated on a separate set of randomly generated testcases that is expected to be
					<strong>harder to solve</strong>, and ranked according to the time spent. Up to 10 bonus points will be given
					according to the ranking.
					<ul>
						<li>
							Your last submission on ZINC will be used for the ranking. No separate submission will be accepted.
						</li>
						<li>
							Late submission will be excluded from the ranking.
						</li>
						<li>
							Programs that produce wrong solutions in Task 9 will be excluded from the ranking.
						</li>
						<li>
							Programs that run slower than our sample solution will be excluded from the ranking.
						</li>
						<li>
							You can use <code>time path/to/your/program &lt; path/to/your/input.txt</code> on Linux and Mac
							to know the time spent by your program.

            <div class="card-body" id="faq">
              <h3 class="card-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
				<p>
				<b>Q</b>: My code doesn't work, there is an error/bug, here is the code, can you help me fix it?<br>
					<b>A</b>: As the assignment is a major course assessment, to be fair, you are supposed to work on it
						on your own and we should not finish the tasks for you. We are happy to help with explanations and
						advice, but we shall not directly debug the code for you.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Q</b>: The demo program enters an infinite loop when given unexpected input (e.g. inputting a
						character when expecting an integer). Is this a bug? <br>
						<b>A</b>: This is just the behavior of <code>cin &gt;&gt; variable;</code> when given input that is
						not type-matched. You don't need to worry about such for PA3, you can assume the user always
						input the correct data type. For example, if we want an <code>int</code>, the user will always
						input an <code>int</code>, not other weird things. However, the user input can still be
						invalid, for example, you want an integer between 1800-9999, and the user may input 1700, or
						12345, etc.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Q</b>: What are the restrictions regarding modifying the header files, writing our own helper
						functions, including extra header files, etc.? <br>
						<b>A</b>: The only hard restriction is that you can only submit <code>main.cpp</code> to ZINC
						and can only use one header file <code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</code>.
						Anything else
						that you do, while not strictly prohibited, <strong>will be at your own risk regarding the PA3
						grading result</strong>. Please keep in mind that there is a grade penalty for all grade appeals that
						include modifications to your already submitted code (no matter how trivial the modification is).
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Q</b>: Am I allowed to use local function declarations (function declaration inside an existing
						function) for my helper functions? <br>
						<b>A</b>: You are strongly discouraged from doing so, as that "feature" is a leftover merely for
						backwards compatibility with C. In C++, it is superseded with class functions and lambda functions,
						which will be taught later in this course.
