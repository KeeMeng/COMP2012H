                        The goal of this assignment is to implement a "deque", which is a special data structure,

                    <h4>Circular doubly-linked list with a sentinel node</h4>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Don't worry about the long name, let's break it down step by step.
                    </p>

                    <h5>Doubly-linked list</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        In the singly-linked list, "delete" is not a handy stuff.
                        Whenever you want to delete a node, you need to first delete it,
                        and then connect its previous node with its next node.
                        However, we cannot visit its previous node from itself, so
                        we need to iterate though the list and always keep track of the
                        previous node of current node.
                    </p>

                    <div style="text-align: center;">
                        <img class="card-img-top" src="comp2012h_pa5_files/images/doubly-linked.png" alt="doubly-linked"
                             style="width: 70%;">
                    </div>

                    <p class="card-text">
                        To solve this problem, we can connect two nodes in both ways:
                        if <code>node_x.next = node_y</code>, then we also have
                        <code>node_y.prev = node_x</code>. Now, we can access the previous node from the node itself,
                        and when we delete node <code>curr</code>, we can simply do
                        <code>curr.prev.next = curr.next</code>, which means "for the previous node of the deleted node,
                        its <code>next</code> pointer will point to the next node of the deleted node now";
                        we also need to update "the previous node of
                        the next node", i.e., <code>curr.next.prev = curr.prev</code>.
                        (Note: special cases will be handled below, when the list only has 0 or 1 items)
                    </p>

                    <div style="text-align: center;">
                        <img class="card-img-top" src="comp2012h_pa5_files/images/doubly-linked-deletion.png" alt="doubly-linked-deletion"
                             style="width: 70%;">
                    </div>

                    <p class="card-text">
                        This frees us from always keeping track of the previous node of current node.
                        Usually in doubly-linked list, we will store both first node and last node
                        of the list, so that we can iterate either from first to last or from last
                        to first backwards.
                    </p>

                    <h5>Sentinel node</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        In the singly-linked list taught during lectures, you may have already noticed
                        something annoying: <em>when we insert or delete an item, we ALWAYS need to check
                        some special cases, e.g., if the list is empty, or if the list contains only
                        one element.</em> The <b>doubly-linked list</b> alone will not solve the problem.
                        For example, when you want to delete an element in the list, you need
                        to consider:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>When the element is the first element</li>
                        <li>When the element is the last element</li>
                        <li>Other cases</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Example implementation in code:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
<code class="language-cpp">if (curr -> prev != nullptr) curr -> prev -> next = curr -> next;
        else first = curr -> next;
if (curr -> next != nullptr) curr -> next -> prev = curr -> prev;
        else last = curr -> prev;
</code></pre>

                    <p class="card-text">
                        To avoid having to check for different cases each time we perform list operation,
                        we can put a dummy <b>"sentinel node"</b> at the beginning of the list,
                        no matter whether the list is empty or not:
                    </p>

                    <div style="text-align: center;">
                        <img class="card-img-top" src="comp2012h_pa5_files/images/sentinel.png" alt="sentinel"
                             style="width: 70%;">
                    </div>

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Now the code becomes:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
<code class="language-cpp">curr -> prev -> next = curr -> next;
if (curr -> next != nullptr) curr -> next -> prev = curr -> prev;
        else last = curr -> prev;
</code></pre>


                    <h5>Circular list with a sentinel</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        The sentinel node is never selected for deletion, so we no longer need to check if 
                        the deleted node is at the beginning of the list.
                        This simplifies the number of cases, but we still need to check if
                        the node to delete is the last element. A solution is to add another sentinel node 
                        at the end; however, it can be more efficient to reuse the existing sentinel node:
                    </p>

                    <div style="text-align: center;">
                        <img class="card-img-top" src="comp2012h_pa5_files/images/circular-sentinel.png" alt="circular-dllist"
                             style="width: 70%;">
                    </div>

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Since the last element is connected with the sentinel node, we say
                        the list is <b>circular</b>. Then there is no need to worry
                        whether the element we are going to delete is the first or last:
                        they will never be! The code now becomes:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
<code class="language-cpp">curr -> prev -> next = curr -> next;
curr -> next -> prev = curr -> prev;
</code></pre>

                    <p class="card-text">
                        That's a <b>circular doubly-linked list with a sentinel</b>.
                        This kind of list should be very simple to implement because there are
                        no special cases to consider!
                    </p>

                        They do this because this structure supports very fast "random access".
                        For example, if we want to get the 30-th element in the deque, we can
                        find out which chunk to look at, and which position the element locates in the chunk
                        <em>by computation</em>, instead of iterating through 30 items from the beginning.

                        However, this is relatively difficult to implement and manipulate. In this assignment,
                        we will <b>replace the "map" shown in the figure above, with a "circular doubly-linked list

                    <h4>Iterator</h4>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        In C++ STL, an <b>iterator</b> is used to point to
                        the memory address of the container (like deque).
                        For better understanding, you can relate them with a pointer, to some extent.
                    </p>

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Why do we need the iterator? Consider the following case: when you now points
                        at the last item in a node, and you want to move on to next item, you need to
                        move to next node in your list. However, it is not possible with only a pointer:
                        you don't know which node you are currently at, not to mention where is your next node!
                    </p>

                    <p class="card-text">
                        To solve that situation, we <b>wrap the pointer and which node we are currently at</b>,
                        into a structure. To be more convenient later, we will record the first and last
                        address of this node, and also keep them in the structure.
                        That's an <b>iterator</b>, and that's exactly what C++ does in its STL.
                    </p>

                        <b>the position next to the last item</b>. This is designed in such a way

                        the file <code>filename</code> always exists, and

                        The actual grading will use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing", target="_blank">Unit Testing</a>,
                        i.e., we will test each functions individually, invoke the function you implemented,
                        and check the return value/expected behavior of that function.
                        The actual grading will also only be triggered, with the scores and test cases revealed, after the
                        deadline. This hidden grading policy is for all the PAs in order to prevent reverse-engineering of
                        the test cases, since the PAs are a significant part of the course assessment and course grade.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        However, please bear in mind that for some functions, <b>we cannot test it without the help
                        of other functions you implemented</b>. For example, if we want to test <code>print_deque()</code>,
                        we must first push, or insert some items into the deque.
                        This is only possible if we invoke your functions like <code>push_back()</code>,
                        since each student may have a different deque structure and we cannot
                        directly modify the inner structure of deque.
                        If any test case fails because of another function you implemented is wrong,
                        it is possible that you may submit an appeal and ask TA to manually check
                        your implementation. More details will be provided after grading process.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        We will execute unit testing on the task functions individually, and some
                        test cases may include invalid input values.
                        All situations for possible invalid inputs have been described in
                        <a href="#tasks">Tasks section</a>. You don't have to check other special cases.
                    </p>

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Please ensure that you submit to ZINC well before the deadline as <strong>all late submissions will
                        be automatically rejected</strong>.

                    <p>
                        <b>Q</b>: My code doesn't work, there is an error/bug, here is the code, can you help me fix it?<br>
                        <b>A</b>: As the assignment is a major course assessment, to be fair, you are supposed to work on it
                        on your own and we should not finish the tasks for you. We are happy to help with explanations and
                        advice, but we shall not directly debug the code for you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Q</b>: What are the restrictions regarding modifying the header files, writing our own helper
                        functions, including extra header files, etc.? <br>
                        <b>A</b>: The only hard restriction is that you can only submit <code>Deque_Iterator.cpp</code>
                        and <code>Deque.cpp</code> to ZINC,
                        and can only use two header files <code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</code> and
                        <code>#include &lt;fstream&gt;</code> in addition to the two header files
                        <code>Deque_Iterator.h</code> and <code>Deque.h</code> we provided.
                        Anything else
                        that you do, while not strictly prohibited, <strong>will be at your own risk regarding the PA5
                        grading result</strong>. Please keep in mind that there is a grade penalty for all grade appeals that
                        include modifications to your already submitted code (no matter how trivial the modification is).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Q</b>: Am I allowed to use local function declarations (function declaration inside an existing
                        function) for my helper functions? <br>
                        <b>A</b>: You are strongly discouraged from doing so, as that "feature" is a leftover merely for
                        backwards compatibility with C. In C++, it is superseded with class functions and lambda functions,
                        which will be taught later in this course.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Q</b>: I am confused about the <code>first</code>, <code>last</code>, <code>start</code>
                        and <code>end</code> pointers.<br>
                        <b>A</b>:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <code>first</code> and <code>last</code> <em>pointers</em> are data members of <b>Iterator</b>
                                that <b>point to the beginning and end of the Node's array</b>. Essentially, 
                                <code>first</code>, <code>last</code> and <code>node</code> should always be updated together
                                to point to the Node containing the item being pointed at by <code>current</code>.
                                They don't care about the Deque structure or how it is implemented (but you can assume
                                the current Node's <code>next</code> and <code>prev</code> are pointing at valid Nodes).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> <em>Iterators</em> are data members of <b>Deque</b>
                                that <b>point to the start and end of the Deque's data range</b>. Their purpose is to tell the
                                Deque which range of items are actually data of the Deque, and any items outside the range
                                are treated as "garbage" values. These should be updated accordingly when the number of items 
                                in the Deque is changed via element insertion or deletion.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Q</b>: When doing <code>insert()</code> and <code>erase()</code>, should we move the elements
                        on the left or right of the inserted/deleted element?<br>
                        <b>A</b>: Either is fine, as long as the Deque is printed out correctly. For example, if your current
                        Deque looks like:<br><br>
                        [_ _ _ _ 1 2 3 4] [5 6 7 8 _ _ _ _] <br><br>
                        and item 5 is deleted, your implementation can cause the Deque to become either of these: <br><br>
                        [_ _ _ _ 1 2 3 4] [6 7 8 _ _ _ _ _] <br>
                        [_ _ _ _ _ 1 2 3] [4 6 7 8 _ _ _ _] <br><br>
                        but as long as the Deque is printed as <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8]</code>, then you should get the point 
                        for relevant test cases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Q</b>: After adding the last item to a Node (for example, <code>push_back()</code> on a Deque
                        so that the final Node's <code>arr[7]</code> is updated), should Iterator <code>end</code> be
                        pointing at the position after <code>arr[7]</code> in the Node, or at the first item in the next
                        Node (<code>node.next->arr[0]</code>)?<br>
                        <b>A</b>: It should point at <b>the first item in the next Node</b> (you may need to make a new Node).
                        Recall that <code>end</code> is an Iterator, so <code>end.current</code> can only point at positions
                        <code>arr[0]</code> to <code>arr[7]</code>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Q</b>: Does <code>deque.ll_size</code> count the Sentinel node? For a newly initialized Deque,
                        should <code>deque.ll_size</code> be 1 or 2?<br>
                        <b>A</b>: Strictly speaking, <code>deque.ll_size</code> does not count the Sentinel node because
                        it does not contribute to the Deque's items. So for a newly initialized Deque, <code>ll_size</code>
                        is 1. However, this property is only for you to help maintain the Deque structure and assist in
                        counting number of items, and not tested in any of the test cases. As long as you maintain this variable
                        and use it correctly, there should be no problem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Q</b>: What does it mean by items having "garbage" values?<br>
                        <b>A</b>: Whenever you initialize a Node with array of size 8, the 8 array elements might hold some 
                        garbage random int values, or set to some value upon initialization. But we don't say that an item 
                        is "deleted" when its value is 0, because it is still a valid integer value. The only thing 
                        determining whether an item is in the Deque or not is if its position is between the 
                        <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> Iterators.
                        <br><br>
                        For more concrete example, suppose your Deque looks like this:
<pre>
[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ] [ 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]
        ^                                ^
        start.current                    end.current
</pre>
                        where <code>deque.start.current</code> points at 3 and <code>end.start.current</code> points at 12. What this means is 
                        that the Deque values are from 3 to 11 (remember end points to the position after last element) 
                        - in other words, if you print out the Deque, it should be:
                        <br><br>
                        [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
                        <br><br>
                        Even if the remaining array positions hold values 1, 2, 13, 14, 15, 16, they don't belong in the 
                        Deque, so we don't care what values they hold. Now, if you "delete" element 7 by simply changing 
                        its value, the new value just becomes a new element in the Deque. You need to maintain the 
                        <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> Iterators, such as: <br><br>
<pre>
[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 ] [ 10, 11, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]
        ^                             ^
        start.current                 end.current
</pre>
                        Now, when printing the Deque, element 7 is truly deleted:
                        <br><br>
                        [3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11]
