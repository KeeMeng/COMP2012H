# COMP2012H
HKUST COMP2012H Programming Assignments
There are a total of 11 PAs, and my implementations are in this repository

PA1: Calendar (C++ basic variables and control loops)
PA2: A simple text processor (Arrays and functions parameter passing)
PA3: Nonogram (Recursion)
PA4: Factorization (Speed programming, separate compilation)
PA5: Deque (Pointer, linked lists, file I/O)
PA6: A mini relational database system (Object construction/destruction, new C++ features)
PA7: PortaWordle, a word game (QT programming)
PA8: "The Lord of the Rings" game (Inheritance and polymorphism)
PA9: Multi-type map using skiplist (Generic programming, static data and functions)
PA10: AI digit recognition (Data preprocessing and network testing)
PA11: A dictionary using trie (rvalue reference, move, data structures and ADT)

Each PA include a descript html, which was downloaded from the course page
Some PAs also contain a "cheatsheet" which combines multiple header files for quick access to class members

I have also included the sublime build files which I used to compile each programming assignment, and you can use it by adding it to your `Sublime Text/Packages/User` folder
