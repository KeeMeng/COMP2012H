							<p class="card-text">
								The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar"  target="_blank">Gregorian calendar</a>
								is the de facto international standard and is used almost everywhere in the world for civil purposes.
								The widely used solar aspect is a cycle of leap days in a 400-year cycle designed to
								keep the duration of the year aligned with the solar year.
							</p>

							<p class="card-text">
								The Gregorian calendar has also been implemented in Linux/Unix command: <code>cal</code>
								and <code>ncal</code>. If you are using Mac or Linux computers, you may try these
								commands in your terminal:

							<p class="card-text">
								Please read the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> section for some common clarifications. You should check that
								a day before the deadline to make sure you don't miss any clarification, even if you have already
								submitted your work by then.

							<h4 id="gregorian-cal">Gregorian calendar</h4>
							<p class="card-text">
								In this assignment, we focus on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar"  target="_blank">Gregorian calendar</a>
								only, you may need to read the Wikipedia page
								<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar"  target="_blank">
									https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar
								</a>
								on what it is, and most importantly, <strong>how many days are there in each month,
								especially February.</strong> The way of calculating leap year <strong>might be different
								</strong> from what you have learnt before.
							</p>

							<br>

							<h4 id="program-overview">Program Overview</h4>
							<p class="card-text">
								After the program is started, it will ask user to input a <strong>year</strong>
								(in range 1800-9999), and then input a <strong>month</strong> (in range 1-12).
								If the user input
								is not valid, the program will continue asking the user to input until a valid
								one is received.
							</p>
							<p class="card-text">
								Next, the program will ask the user whether he/she would like to use
								Monday or Sunday as the first day of a week. If user chooses Monday,
								then the calendar displayed later will start each week on Monday, and
								vice versa.
								If the user input
								is not valid, the program will continue asking the user to input until a valid
								one is received.
							</p>
							<p class="card-text">
								Then, the program will ask the user if they want the calendar to
								print horizontally or vertically. If user chooses horizontally,
								then the calendar will look like the one using <code>cal</code> command
								on Linux, otherwise it will look like the one using <code>ncal</code> command.
								Again, if the user input
								is not valid, the program will continue asking the user to input until a valid
								one is received.
							</p>
							<p class="card-text">
								Note that in <a href="#bonus-tasks">bonus tasks</a>, the user
							may input <code>-1</code> or <code>-3</code> for month. In this situation,
							the next two options (start week on Monday/Sunday, and print horizontally/vertically)
							will be disabled. The program will directly print calendar after user enters
							the month.
							</p>

							<br>

							<h4>How to calculate which day it is for a certain date?</h4>
							<p class="card-text">
								The only thing you have is that <strong>the January 1st of year 1800 is a Wednesday</strong>.
								All other you need is in the Wikipedia link given in
								<a href="#gregorian-cal">Gregorian calendar</a>
								part above.
								<strong>Actually you only need to figure out how many days are there in each month.</strong>
							</p>

							<p class="card-text">
								You are expected to <strong>calculate</strong> which day it is for a certain date when you
								display the calendar later.
							</p>

							<p class="card-text">
								The calendar rules used before 1800 are different to the rules we use today, due to
								some historic reasons. So in this PA, you only need to work on calendars
								<strong>after year 1800</strong>.

							</p>

							<br>

							<h4>Additional Remarks</h4>
							<p class="card-text">
								In this assignment, you can feel free to use anything you know, and there is no
								need to restrict yourself to only use what we have taught so far. For example,
								if you think using a function will make your codes tidy, feel free to do it.
								However, <strong> you can only use header file <code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</code>
								</strong>.
							</p>
							<p class="card-text">
								If you would like to try the bonus tasks, it is very likely that you
								will find functions useful. Otherwise, your codes might look quite messy.

				<h4>Task 1 - Receive and validate user input</h4>
				<p class="card-text">
					As described in <a href="#program-overview">Program Overview</a>, ask the user to
					input (1) year, (2) month, (3) start each week on Monday or Sunday, and
					(4) print horizontally or vertically.
				</p>

				<p class="card-text">
					If the user input is not valid, the program will keep asking the user to input until a valid one is received.
					You don't need to consider the cases when user input incorrect data types. For example,
					if we want an integer, you can assume the user will always input an integer, not
					a character, etc.
				</p>

				<p class="card-text">
					<strong>For students who do bonus part: </strong> You should skip (3) and (4)

				<h4>Bonus Task 2 - Print calendar of adjacent 3 months</h4>
				<p class="card-text">
					This is a bonus task, please see grading details in

				<p class="card-text">
					When user chooses to print the calendar of adjacent 3 months
					(last month, current month, and next month), indicating by
					first enter a valid year, and then enter -3 as month.
					Then, the program will ask which month do the user want to print as current month
					(note that we only have this prompt in this task).
					After that, we will start each week on Sunday and print the calendar horizontally.
				</p>

				<p class="card-text">
					<strong>Note: </strong> Since we only process year 1800-9999, so if user want
					to print adjacent 3 months, with Jan 1800 or Dec 9999 as current month,
					we will consider the case invalid, and your program should ask user to input again.
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						You should print the three months in the same row. Two adjacent months
						in the same row should be separated by two spaces. For each month,
						<ul>
							<li>
								A sub-title should be displayed, with format "[Month Name] [Year]", for example,
								"August 2022". To make it easier, please make it left-aligned.
							</li>
							<li>
								Display the names of weekdays, from "Su" to "Sa", words should be
								separated by one space.
							</li>
							<li>
								Finally, format the calendar like the example below. Dates should be
								separated by one space, and for dates with only one digit, the digit
								should be right-aligned.

					Automated Grading on the
						<a href="https://zinc.cse.ust.hk/">ZINC Online Submission System</a>.
						Compress the single source code file <code>main.cpp</code> by itself as <code>PA1.zip</code>

				<h4 id="grading">Grading Scheme</h4>
				<p class="card-text">
					The grading process will be performed entirely on
					<a href="https://zinc.cse.ust.hk/">ZINC Online Submission System</a>.
					We will input some contents to your program, and
					<strong>simply compare its output with expected output</strong>.
					To avoid being too demanding, ZINC will consider the results are identical
					as long as they "look exactly the same". To be more specific,
					<strong>trailing spaces at the end of each line and a newline character
					at the end of the file will be ignored.</strong>
					<!-- <h4 style="color:red;"> To TA: please remember to turn on
					"ignore trailing spaces" and "ignore blank lines after file" options on ZINC.</h4> -->
				</p>
				<p class="card-text">
					For example, if two lines are
					<code>"1 2 3 4"</code> and <code>"1 2 3 4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"</code>,
					they will be considered identical. However,
					if two lines are <code>"1 2"</code> and <code>"1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2"</code>,
					they are not the same, since we only
					ignore spaces <strong>at the end of each line/the file</strong>.
				</p>
				<p class="card-text">
					Before the deadline, the test cases on ZINC will only contain a few cases. If you passed
					those tests, it only means your program can successfully run on ZINC and can pass
					those test cases. The result is by no means complete and the score is irrelavant to
					your actual score.
					In the actual grading stage after the deadline, we will use a <strong>totally different set of
					test cases</strong>, which is expected to be more complete and more strict,
					to test the correctness of your program.
				</p>
				<p class="card-text">
					Please ensure that you submit to ZINC well before the deadline as <strong>all late submissions will
					be automatically rejected</strong>.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p class="card-text">
					<strong>Note:</strong> When testing Task 1-5, we guarantee that there won't be input where month is -1 or -3.
					So even if you complete Bonus part, your grade in Task 1-5 will not be affected.

				<h4 id="how_to_test">How to test my program</h4>

					You may compile your code using this command:
					(the <code>-Wall</code> flag is optional, it will show all warnings to you)
					<pre><code class="language-bash">g++ -o main main.cpp -std=c++11 -Wall</code></pre>
					Next, please place <code>main, input.txt, output.txt</code>
					(i.e., the sample input/output that we provided)
					in the same folder, and
					let your program read input from file <code>input.txt</code> and output result
					to file <code>my_output.txt</code> by using this command:
					(you can change the filename, e.g. input3.txt and output3.txt, etc.)
					<pre><code class="language-bash">./main < input.txt > my_output.txt</code></pre>
					If you are using Windows PowerShell, you may use the following command instead:
					<pre><code class="language-bash">Get-Content input.txt | ./main > my_output.txt</code></pre>
					Then you may check if your output in
					<code>my_output.txt</code> is the same as the expected output <code>output.txt</code>
					by using <a href="https://www.diffchecker.com/diff">this online diff checker tool</a>
				</p>
				<img src="comp2012h_pa1_files/diff-checker.png" width="100%"/>

					By default it will not ignore trailing spaces and blank lines, you need to

				</p>
				<br>
				<p class="card-text">
					<strong>Alternative: </strong>
					If you are using a Linux machine (MacOS is not ok) or using CS Lab 2 machines, you can directly
					use this command:
					<pre><code class="language-bash">diff -Z -B output.txt my_output.txt</code></pre>
					This command will automatically ignore trailing spaces and blank lines.
					If you see nothing after executing this command, then the contents in these two files
					is considered the same.

              <h3 class="card-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
				<p>
				<b>Q</b>: My code doesn't work, there is an error/bug, here is the code, can you help me fix it?<br>
					<b>A</b>: As the assignment is a major course assessment, to be fair, you are supposed to work on it
						on your own and we should not finish the tasks for you. We are happy to help with explanations and
						advice, but we shall not directly debug the code for you.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Q</b>: The demo program enters an infinite loop when given unexpected input (e.g. inputting a
						character when expecting an integer). Is this a bug? <br>
						<b>A</b>: This is just the behavior of <code>cin &gt;&gt; variable;</code> when given input that is
						not type-matched. You don't need to worry about such for PA1, you can assume the user always
						input the correct data type. For example, if we want an <code>int</code>, the user will always
						input an <code>int</code>, not other weird things. However, the user input can still be
						invalid, for example, you want an integer between 1800-9999, and the user may input 1700, or
						12345, etc.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Q</b>: What are the restrictions regarding modifying the header files, writing our own helper
						functions, including extra header files, etc.? <br>
						<b>A</b>: The only hard restriction is that you can only submit <code>main.cpp</code> to ZINC, and
						include only one header file <code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</code>. Anything else
						are not strictly prohibited, as long as your code can run on ZINC.
