							which is a key in important applications such as <a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">RSA public-key encryption</a> in
							a speedy manner.

						<p class="card-text">
							Please read the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> section regularly, and do check it
							one day before the deadline to make sure you don't miss any clarification,
							even if you have already submitted your work by then. You can also raise questions

						<!-- <h4>Code structure</h4>
						<p class="card-text">
							The skeleton code structure is as follows:
						</p>
						<pre>PA2&#10;└── main.cpp&#10;</pre>
						<p class="card-text">
							Your task for this PA is to implement 10 functions in <code>main.cpp</code>.
						</p> -->

						<p class="card-text">
							Basically, we want to perform factorization for all integers in a given range and print the
							results.
						</p>
						<p class="card-text">
							The input arguments will be from the command line. You may read <a
								href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/command-line-arguments-in-c-cpp/">this article</a>
							to learn about how you might retrieve them in C++. To provide command line arguments to your
							program you will have to compile and run your program in a terminal. Please feel free to do
							that in any terminal you are familiar with.
							<!-- You can also access one in the VS Code according to the instruction in <a
								href="https://course.cse.ust.hk/comp2011/labs/vscode/#terminal">this section</a> on our
							VS Code tutorial page. -->
							However, if you want to time your program, you may want to use our
							lab 2 Linux machines. Instructions can be found in the next section: <a
								href="#timing">Timing your program</a>.
						</p>
						<p class="card-text">
							Assuming the name of your program is <code>factorize</code>, we may use the following
							command in the terminal:
						</p>
						<pre><code>factorize [range_start] [range_end]</code></pre>

						<p class="card-text">The <b>[range_start]</b> and <b>[range_end]</b> are the integers that
							specify the range. For
							example, <code>factorize 12 23</code> will print out the factorization results for all
							integers in the range [12, 23] in ascending order like so:</p>
						<pre><code>12=2*2*3
13=13
14=2*7
15=3*5
16=2*2*2*2
17=17
18=2*3*3
19=19
20=2*2*5
21=3*7
22=2*11
23=23
</code></pre>
						<p class="card-text">The output is pretty straightforward as you can see: each line consists of
							the integer being
							factorized at the beginning, then the equal sign, and finally the factorization result with
							a single <code>endl</code> character added at the end. The prime factors, which are
							separated by asterisks, in the factorization result must also be listed in ascending order.
						</p>

						<p class="card-text">Your program should output nothing else and require no user interaction.
							(i.e. don't need to
							take in any standard console input with <code>cin</code>)</p>

						<p class="card-text">For simplicity, you can assume the provided input arguments
							<b>[range_start]</b> and
							<b>[range_end]</b> are positive integers between 2 and 2<sup>63</sup> - 1 inclusively (i.e.
							it can be
							stored in a <code>long long</code> variable), and that <b>[range_start]</b> is no larger
							than <b>[range_end]</b>.
						</p>

						<!-- <br>

						<h4>Important Requirements</h4>
						<p class="card-text">
							There are a few things you CANNOT do. Failure to observe these rules would potentially
							result in ZERO mark for your assignment. Please carefully check your code before you submit
							it.
						<ul>
							<li>
								This assignment is all about string operation exercises, so you are NOT allowed to
								include any additional libraries for example <code>cstring</code> and
								<code>string.h</code>.
							</li>
							<li>
								You are NOT allowed to modify any of the given function prototypes including the return
								types, function names, and parameter lists.
							</li>
							<li>
								You are NOT allowed to define any additional global variable. You can only use those
								provided in the skeleton codes.
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h3 class="card-title">Timing your program</h3>

						<p class="card-text">
							We will be using the <code>time</code> Linux utility to measure the runtime performance of
							your
							program. You may use this utility on any of our CS Lab 2 (Linux Lab) machines either locally
							in
							the lab or remotely via SSH. The following shows you how using the SSH client in the Virtual
							Barn. <u>You may adjust the steps accordingly if you are familiar with installing and using
								a
								SSH client on your own computer</u>.
						</p>

						<ol>
							<li>
								Remote control a Windows machine in <a
									href="https://itsc.ust.hk/services/academic-teaching-support/facilities/virtual-barn/overview">HKUST
									virtual barn</a>. After following the installation guide and user guide there to
								install the remote control client and connect to the HKUST network, choose the
								Programming Software server when you are offered a selection of different servers.
							</li>
							<li>
								Copy your files to Virtual Barn. If you have no idea how, you can email yourself the
								files and then download them there.
							</li>
							<li>
								Open <code>PuTTY</code>. There is a shortcut on your Desktop.
								Enter <code>csl2wk13.cse.ust.hk</code> as the Host Name. Note: If
								that one server doesn't work, you may try other servers such as
								<code>csl2wk14.cse.ust.hk</code> and <code>csl2wk15.cse.ust.hk</code>. The server number
								goes up to at
								least 40.
								<br><img src="misc/putty1.png">
							</li>
							<li>
								Click Open. If a warning about the security key shows up, click Yes to dismiss it.
								<br><img src="misc/putty2.png">
							</li>
							<li>
								Enter your CSD login and password. (Register one if you haven't done so in lab 1 by
								following
								the lab 1 instructions.) It may not show what you type when you are typing in the
								password. Don't worry, just type your password and hit the Enter key. You should login
								to your <em>home</em> directory. Enter the command <code>pwd</code> (Print Working
								Directory) to verify this. It
								should show <code>/homes/your_login</code>
								<br><img src="misc/putty3.png">
							</li>
							<li>
								Open <code>FileZilla</code> from Start Menu. Click "File" -&gt;
								"Site Manager" -&gt; "New Site". Choose <b>SFTP</b> for protocol according to the
								screenshot below. Enter <code>csl2wk13.cse.ust.hk</code> (or
								whatever server you used in a previous step) as Host. Choose "Ask for password" for the
								Logon Type.
								<br><img src="misc/filezilla.png">
							</li>
							<li>
								Click Connect and then enter your CSD login and password.
							</li>
							<li>
								If the connection succeeds, the right side should show your home directory at Linux Lab.
								Copy your factorize.cpp file by dragging it to the right side. That would upload the
								file to <code>/homes/your_login</code>. You can close <code>FileZilla</code> after doing
								so.
							</li>
							<li>
								Go back to <code>PuTTY</code>, and compile your program using the
								following command:
								<pre><code>g++ -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -std=c++11 -o factorize factorize.cpp</code></pre>
							</li>
							<li>
								If no compilation errors occur, you should be able to time and run your program by
								adding <code>/usr/bin/time -v</code> before the command to be timed. For example:
								<pre><code>/usr/bin/time -v factorize 9234567890 9234567899</code></pre>
								<p class="card-text">Output like the following will be printed:</p>

						<h3 class="card-title">Submission &amp; Grading</h3>
						<p class="card-text">
							<strong>Deadline: 8 October 2022 Saturday HKT 23:59.</strong><br>
							Submit a single source file <code>factorize.cpp</code> to <a
								href="https://zinc.cse.ust.hk/">ZINC</a>.
						</p>

						<h3 class="card-title">Cite External Materials</h3>
						<p>If you have referred to any external materials, please cite them in your ZINC submission. Add a comment 
							at the beginning (line 1) of the source file. If you have already submitted, please kindly add the references 
							(if any) and submit again. It is fine to learn ideas and algorithms from external materials, 
							but you have to write the codes yourself.</p>

						<h3 class="card-title">Grading scheme</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Your program should generate the exact same output as our sample program's.</li>
							<li>Your program should run no significantly slower than our unoptimized sample program.
								That means its running time cannot be more than double of that of ours. For example, if
								our sample program can generate the results in 5 seconds, your program should not take
								more than 10 seconds to do the same.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>You need to fulfill both requirements to be considered as correct for a test case. We will
							test your program on multiple hard test cases (very large number) for multiple times and the
							result (average time for one test case) will be released. This will happen outside ZINC as
							it doesn't support timing. In ZINC, we only provide a simple test case that factorizes 2 to
							100 to help you debug.
						</p>
						<h3 class="card-title">Speed programming competition (Bonus)</h3>
						<p>For this assignment, we will also reward the students that have mastered the art of speed
							programming up to 10 bonus points.

						<ul>
							<li>Your last submission on ZINC will be used for the ranking. No separate submission will
								be accepted.</li>
							<li>Late submission will be excluded from ranking.</li>
							<li>We only rank those programs with correct outputs. If your program does wrong in any test
								cases, it will be excluded from ranking.</li>
							<li>Programs running not that fast will be excluded from ranking. If your running time &gt;
								1.1 &times; running time of the demo program, it will not be ranked.
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h3 class="card-title">Hardwares for grading</h3>
						<p>Currently, the plan is to grade the submissions on CS Linux Lab machines, so:
						<ul>
							<li>Please make sure your program can be compiled with this
								command on the above mentioned
								machines<br><code>g++ -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -std=c++11 -O3 factorize.cpp -o factorize</code>
							</li>
							<li>The above mentioned machines each has 8GB memories in total, and definitely we can never
								occupy all of them, so make sure your program's memory use is reasonable. Maybe you can
								test it yourself before the final submission.
							</li>
							<li>
								Your program will not be able to access the network.
